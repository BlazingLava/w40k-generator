# W40k Army List Generator

This is a pet project whose purpose is to generate valid random lists per Warhammer 40,000's 9th edition. It currently supports:

* Necrons (other factions can be added);
* Single patrol detachment per list.

## Potential improvement

* Add more optional preferences (ex.: max units, prioritise painted models, identify proxies, custom percentages, etc.);
* Handle bad configuration (ex.: wrong unit name).
