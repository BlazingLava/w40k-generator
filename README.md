# W40k Army List Generator

This is a pet project whose purpose is to generate valid random lists per Warhammer 40,000's 9th edition. It currently supports:

* Necrons (other factions can be added);
* Single patrol detachment per list.

## Potential improvement

* Roll unit type before rolling unit, to better represent sparse categories (ex.: Dedicated Transport);
* Add more optional preferences, ex.: max units, prioritise painted models, identify proxies, etc.
